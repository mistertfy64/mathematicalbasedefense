## Play
There are enemies (squares with numbers on it) coming to your base.
You must kill these enemies by forming problems for the enemies using tiles in the 7Ã—7 grid.
There are number tiles, operator tiles, and variable tiles.
There are many ways to "select" a tile. You can click on it, or you can use the numpad.
